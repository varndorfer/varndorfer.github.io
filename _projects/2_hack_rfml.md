Undergraduate research project in the field of Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML) that resulted in a research paper accepted as part of the ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning (WiseML 2020). This project investigated loss metrics for training a radio frequency transmitter to evade detection using machine learning.
